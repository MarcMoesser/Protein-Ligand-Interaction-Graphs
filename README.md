# Protein-Ligand-Interaction-Graphs

This is the repository for (LINK PAPER)

## 1) Create Protein-Ligand Interaction Graphs

The code needed to generate PLIGs from a protein-ligand complex can be found in the "PLIG_tutorial/" folder.
## 2) Run a PLIG or MLPNet model

All GNN implementations of PLIGs as well as the MLPNet implementation of ECFP/FCFP and ECIF fingperints can be found in the "models_main/" folder.

The following data is supplied:
##### i) All hyperparameter tuned GNN PLIG, GNN ligand-based, MLPNet ECIF and MLPNet ECFP/FCFP models 
##### ii) Pre-prepared features (PLIGs, ECIF, ECFP/FCFP) for the PDBbind 2020 general + PDBbind 2016 refined set
##### iii) an example config file needed for model training

## 3) Figures and data presented in the publication

All raw-data to generate the figure published in (LINK PAPER) can be found in the "publication/" folder
